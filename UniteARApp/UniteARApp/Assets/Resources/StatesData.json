            "intro": "Maharashtra is India's second-most populous state and third-largest state by area. Spread over 307,713 km2 (118,809 sq mi), it is bordered by the Arabian Sea to the west and the Indian states of Karnataka, Telangana, Goa, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh and the Union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli. It is also the world's second-most populous subnational entity.",
            "history": "Maharashtra was ruled by the Maurya Empire in the fourth and third centuries BCE. Around 230 BCE, Maharashtra came under the rule of the Satavahana dynasty for 400 years.[28] The greatest ruler of the Satavahana dynasty was Gautamiputra Satakarni. In 90 CE, Vedishri, son of the Satavahana king Satakarni, the "Lord of Dakshinapatha, wielder of the unchecked wheel of Sovereignty", made Junnar, 30 miles north of Pune, the capital of his kingdom. The state was also ruled by Western Satraps, Gupta Empire, Gurjara-Pratihara, Vakataka, Kadambas, Chalukya Empire, Rashtrakuta Dynasty, and Western Chalukya before finally, the Yadava rule. The Buddhist Ajanta Caves in present-day Aurangabad display influences from the Satavahana and Vakataka style. The caves were possibly excavated during this period.",
            "geography": "Maharashtra occupies the western and central part of the country and has a long coastline stretching 720 kilometres[58] along the Arabian Sea.[59] One of the more prominent physical features of Maharashtra is the Deccan plateau, which is separated from the Konkan coastline by 'Ghats'. The Ghats are a succession of steep hills, periodically bisected by narrow roads. Most of the famous hill stations of the state are at the Ghats. The Western Ghats (or the Sahyadri Mountain range) provide a physical backbone to the state on the west, while the Satpura Hills along the north and Bhamragad-Chiroli-Gaikhuri ranges on the east serve as its natural borders. The state is surrounded by Gujarat to the north west, Madhya Pradesh to the north, Chhattisgarh to the east, Telangana to the south east, Karnataka to the south and Goa to the south west.",
            "economy": "The economy of Maharashtra is driven by manufacturing, international trade, Mass Media (television, motion pictures, video games, recorded music), aerospace, technology, petroleum, fashion, apparel, and tourism. Maharashtra is the most industrialised state and has maintained the leading position in the industrial sector in India.[142] The State is pioneer in small scale industries. Mumbai, the capital of state and the financial capital of India, houses the headquarters of most of the major corporate and financial institutions. India's main stock exchanges and capital market and commodity exchanges are located in Mumbai. ",
            "food": "Maharashtra cuisine covers a range from mild to very spicy dishes. Wheat, rice, jowar, bajri, vegetables, lentils and fruit form staple food of the Maharashtrian diet. Some of the popular traditional dishes include puran poli, ukdiche modak, and batata wada. Misal Pav,Pav Bhaji and Vada pav are dishes that became very popular in the last fifty years.[215] Meals (mainly lunch and dinner) are served on a plate called thali. Each food item served on the thali has a specific place. In some households, meals begin with a thanksgiving offering of food (Naivedya) to the household Gods. Maharashtrian cuisine has many regional varieties including Malvani (Konkani),Kolhapuri and Varhadhi.Though quite different, both use a lot of seafood and coconut.[217] The staple foods of the Konkani people are rice and fish",
            "culture": "Maharashtrian artists have made major contributions to Indian Classical music. Its vibrant folk form includes Powada, Bharuds and Gondhals.",

            "intro": "Embedded in the heart of India is Uttar Pradesh, a land where cultures have evolved and religions emerge. The greatness of Uttar Pradesh lies not only in this confluence, but also in the emergence of cultural and religious traditions along some of the greatest rivers in the Indian sub-continent – the Ganga and the Yamuna.Throughout history, great cities have emerged and established along great rivers. Within India, the Ganga and the Yamuna have nurtured a culture because of which religious faith, rituals, culture and intellectual enlightenment have evolved in places along the two rivers.",
            "history": "The history of Uttar Pradesh is very much associated with the broad history of India. It dates back to 4000 years. Formerly the area of Uttar Pradesh was occupied by the Aryans or the Dasas and their main occupation was agriculture. The Aryans, through conquests occupied the adjoining areas too.\r\nThey laid the foundations their civilisation in the region. It was during the Aryan inhabitation in the region that epics of Mahabharata, Ramayana, Brahmanas and Puranas were written.\r\nThe state is the heart of Mahabharata war.\r\nIt was around the middle of the 1st millennium BC that Uttar Pradesh saw the advent of Lord Buddha.During Ashoka`s reign, several public welfare works were taken up. During the rule of Magadha Empire, Buddhism and Jainism developed in this region. It was a period of administrative and economic advancement.\r\nUttar Pradesh reached the peak of prosperity during the Mughal Rule.\r\nThe British East India Company came into contact with rulers of Awadh during the reign of third Nawab of Awadh. Uttar Pradesh also played a key role in the 1857 War of Independence.\r\nUttar Pradesh has seen it all, from the rule of Rama to the rule of British.",
            "geography": "A fertile terrain of the Gangetic plain, the sprawling State spread over in 2,40,928 sq. km. area, touches the Himalayan foothills to the north and the Vindhya ranges to the south, surrounded by the states of Uttarakhand, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and shares International border with Nepal.\r\nIt is here that one can dive down the stream of ancient Indian philosophy. It is the land which is glorified by the stream of Indian spirituality i.e. the great Ganga & Yamuna and the footprints of legends like Ram, Krishna, Buddha, Jain Tirthankars & Sufi Saints and the sites associated with them.",
            "economy": "Uttar Pradesh is the most populous state in the country accounting for 16.4 per cent of the country’s population.\r\nThe major sector of Uttar Pradesh economy is Agriculture. Wheat, pulses, oilseeds, rice, sugarcane, and potatoes are the main crops grown here. Sugarcane is an important cash crop grown here. Apples and mangoes are also produced in this state.",
            "food": "Uttar Pradesh has a rich and diverse cuisine ranging from traditional to the modern. The culinary narrative of Uttar Pradesh reflects the diversity of its cultural landscape.\r\nFrom the court cuisine of Awadh to the vegetarian fare of Braj region of Mathura and Vrindavan, from the pasandas of the Rampur kitchens to the delectable Banarasi paan, from its mouthwatering street food to its petha of Agra, Uttar Pradesh truly has the full measure of keeping one satiated...if not hungry for more.",
            "culture": "#Culture encompasses the way of life of a society. It includes the attitude of the people toward others, their behaviour, mannerisms and ways to celebrate different aspects of life. It also includes the ways in which the people express themselves through fine and performing arts. #\r\nUttar Pradesh's greatest gifts to humanity are the two epics, 'Ramayana' and 'Mahabharata'. From the epic age, the territory of Uttar Pradesh was influenced by several fresh streams of culture among which the two most significant being those generated by the teachings of the Buddha and Mahavira, the 24th Jain Tirthankar.\r\n\r\nThe fountainheads of Brahmanical culture were centered at holy places as Kashi, Ayodhya, Prayag, Mathura and the Himalayan hermitages. \r\nIts people belong to many religions and come from distant parts of the country but have had the latitude to recreate their own native cultures. Afghans, Kashmiris, Bengalis, Parsis and Punjabi immigrants settled here. Christians, Hindus, Muslims and Buddhists all found the freedom to practise their religions and pass it on to successive generations.\r\nWhile it is secular, liberal and progressive, at the same time it is deeply rooted in social and religious traditions and taboos.",
